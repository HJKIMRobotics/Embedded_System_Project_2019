# Embedded-Systems-Project

The robot autonomously navigated around a track using one or more sensor types. The project culminated with a competition to find the fastest buggy.

A working robot buggy required many technical skills to combine: a battery power source, gearbox selection, control circuits for motor drives, drive shaft encoders as well as an array of sensors and the software to control the robot.

The project also performed the development of team working and project management skills, which were central to modern engineering.

Project teams were formed a mix of degree programmes and abilities

The Embedded Systems Project begun in laboratories and workshops which deal with topics such as:

• Motors and sensors

• Introduction to Software Design

• PWM and the STM32 microcontroller

• Control systems

• Engineering Drawing
